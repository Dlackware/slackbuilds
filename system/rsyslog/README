rsyslog (enhanced syslogd)

rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, among others, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
failover log destinations, syslog/tcp, fine grain output format control,
high precision timestamps, queued operations and the ability to filter on
any message part.
It is quite compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in
replacement (remove sysklogd before installing).
It has a default config taken from the standard slackware sysklogd one and
is setted up to emulate it.

available build time switches (pass the variables to the build script):
- MYSQL=yes for mysql support;
- PGSQL=yes for postgresql support (you'll need postgresql, available on
slackbuilds.org, installed);
- LIBDBI=yes for libdbi support (you'll need libdbi and libdbi-drivers,
available on slackbuilds.org, installed);
- GNUTLS=yes for gnutls support.
you can see even more options if you run "./configure --help"
in the uncompressed sources folder.
