QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for 
one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). 
By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performances.

qemu-kvm achieves near native performances by leveraging the kvm-kmod
modules and executing the guest code directly on the host CPU.
Slackware provides pre-built 32/64 bit x86 kvm-kmod modules or you can
build different versions with the kvm-kmod package.
qemu-kvm code has been merged back into qemu since version 1.3.0.

The qemu SlackBuild patches the installed udev rules so that you
no longer are required to use the system group 'kvm' as the default.
The 'users' group is set as the default in this SlackBuild.
If you want to use a different group, then run the SlackBuild like this:
  KVMGROUP=group sh qemu.SlackBuild

Don't forget to load the 'kvm-intel' or 'kvm-amd' module (depending on 
your processor) prior to launching qemu-system-x86_64 with kvm enabled.

By default this SlackBuild builds only the arm emulation targets for
qemu, if you intead prefeer to build all supported targets, pass also
the TARGETS=all variable to the script.

spice and usbredir are optional dependencies.
