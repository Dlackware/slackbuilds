emelFM2 is a file manager for UNIX-like operating systems.  It uses
a simple and efficient interface pioneered by Norton Commander in
the 1980's.  It features a two pane window located side-by-side
to show the contents of the selected filesystem directories, and
a third pane at the bottom that shows the output of commands.

Command line switches are:
UDISKS=no (default yes): use hal instead of udisks
GTK3=yes (default no): use gtk3 instead of gtk2
