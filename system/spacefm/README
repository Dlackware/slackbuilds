SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file manager for Linux
with built-in VFS, udev-based device manager,
customizable menu system, and bash integration.

udevil is the optional preconfigured dependency to mount
as non-root, but it can alternatively use the already
available udisks. ktsuss and leafpad are the
preconfigured helper apps for graphical su and editor,
but still you can set what you prefeer as alternatives.
You can do this also editing the default-session file
before building the package.

If you want to use it as the default file and desktop
manager in your installed LXDE, you can avoid building
pcmanfm and deps, install this instead, and run these
two sed commands

sed -i "s|pcmanfm|spacefm|" \
  /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
sed -i "s|pcmanfm|spacefm|" \
  /usr/share/lxpanel/profile/LXDE/panels/panel
