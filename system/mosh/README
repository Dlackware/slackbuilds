mosh (mobile shell)

Remote terminal application that allows roaming, supports intermittent
connectivity, and provides intelligent local echo and line editing of
user keystrokes.
Mosh is a replacement for SSH. It's more robust and responsive,
especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.
This needs protobuf and perl-IO-Tty.

Mosh works only with UTF-8 locales, so be sure to set yourself one in
/etc/profile.d/lang.sh, like

export LANG=it_IT.UTF-8

and comment out the LC_COLLATE line in the same file.

also, you must add this line to your /etc/ssh/ssh_config on the client

SendEnv LANG LC_COLLATE

and this other to your /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server you're
connecting to

AcceptEnv LANG LC_COLLATE
