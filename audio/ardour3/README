Ardour is an application to fit the needs of musicians under Linux.
It is designed to be a fully functional professional audio application,
that uses the professional sound server jack for sound i/o.

Ardour requires liblo, liblrdf, scons, libgnomecanvasmm, aubio,
jack-audio-connection-kit.

If you want ardour with lv2 support pass LV2=yes to the script. This
will additionally need lilv (suil is an optional dependency).

If you want support for controlling ardour via a wiimote device, you'll
need to pass WIIMOTE=yes to the script. You need cwiid for that.
Note that this option might be broken.

For building ardour with support for VST-plugins, you have to pass
VST=yes to the script. This will additionally require wine. Please
note that VST-support will not be built on x86_64, regardless of
the option passed.

This script builds the development version of the application:
it might not be wise to install side by side with the stable
version (install one or the other).
