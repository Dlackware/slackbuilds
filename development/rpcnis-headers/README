rpcnis-headers (RPC NIS header files)

RPC NIS headers no more in glibc >= 2.14.

In the intentions of Ulrich Drepper you shouldn't
need these headers at all and use instead the
headers provided by libtirpc in /usr/include/tirpc
for software that requires rpc.
In practice it doesn't always work like that and
this might be needed.
