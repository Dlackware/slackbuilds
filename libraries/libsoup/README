Soup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of
a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation, but the SOAP code
was later removed (and then later partially reimplemented...).

glib-networking is required.
Optional dependencies for libsoup-gnome are libproxy and gnome-keyring.
