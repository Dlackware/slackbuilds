libvirt - The virtualization API

libvirt is a toolkit to interact with the virtualization
capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes).

you can pass to the build script the qemu group you are
using with the variable VIRTGROUP (defaults to 'libvirt'
but can be handy to specify an existing group).

if you want to start the libvirt daemon at boot add this
to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

# Start libvirt:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.libvirt start
fi
