libvirt - The virtualization API

libvirt is a toolkit to interact with the virtualization
capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes).

Most dependencies (like qemu and virtualbox) are autodetected
and having the required libs in place will build the respective
features automatically.

The group can be specified at build time like this:
VIRTGROUP=somegroup ./libvirt.SlackBuild (default: users)

Please read README.Slackware for additional informations.
