libvirt - The virtualization API

libvirt is a toolkit to interact with the virtualization
capabilities of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes).

Most dependencies (like qemu and virtualbox) are autodetected
and having the required libs in place will build the respective
features automatically.

The default group libvirt uses can be specified at build time like
this: VIRTGROUP=somegroup ./libvirt.SlackBuild (default: users)

Please read README.Slackware for additional informations.

netcat-openbsd is an optional dependency if you plan to connect
from a remote host using virt-manager.
