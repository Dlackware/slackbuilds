freenx (Free implementation of the NX Server)

Freenx is an application/thin-client server based on nx technology.
NoMachine nx is the next-generation X compression and roundtrip suppression scheme. It can operate remote X11 sessions over 56k modem dialup links or anything better.
This package contains a free (GPL) implementation of the nxserver component.

Because a nx user with some default settings is needed for the server to build, a script, preinstall.sh, is provided to be executed (sh preinstall.sh) before running the slackbuild: it's pretty straightforward in his functions, have a look at it.
