Mozilla Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) is meant for 
organizations that manage their client desktops, including schools,
businesses and other institutions that want to offer Firefox.

Note: this package is not compatible/substitutes Slackware's
mozilla-firefox package: install only one of the two.

Also note that the package generated from this SlackBuild will be
branded like an official Mozilla.org Slackware package, so
it cannot be redistributed.
