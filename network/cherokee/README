Cherokee is a very fast, flexible and easy to configure Web Server
written by Alvaro Lopez Ortega <alvaro@alobbs.com>.
It supports the widespread technologies nowadays: FastCGI, SCGI,
PHP, CGI, SSI, TLS and SSL encrypted connections, Virtual hosts,
Authentication, on the fly encoding, Load Balancing, Apache
compatible log files, Data Base Balancing, Reverse HTTP Proxy,
Traffic Shaper, Video Streaming and much more.

A user friendly interface called cherokee-admin is provided for a
no-hassle configuration of the server.

If you are installing a high load http server, you will probably need
a zero-downtime process of log rotation. To achieve this, I strongly
recommend you to take a look to this cookbook:
  *  http://www.cherokee-project.com/doc/cookbook_managing_logs.html

If need to get popular web applications working or fine tune your
server, follow the cherokee's cookbooks page:

Notes about using this SlackBuild
---------------------------------

1) To specify the WWW root directory pass WWWROOT=/path/to/www/root
   to the script, like this:

      WWWROOT=/var/www ./cherokee.SlackBuild

   in a similar way you can pass the variables WWWUSER (defining
   the default user cherokee will run as) and WWWGROUP (the default
   group): the value of those two variables defaults to "apache".
2) If you want to enable IPv6 support, pass IPV6=yes to the script.
3) If you want to disable the Cherokee-admin installation, pass
   ADMIN=no to the script.
4) This script builds Cherokee with support for MySQL client library
   by default. If you want to avoid the dependency on MySQL client
   library, or just build Cherokee without this support, pass MYSQL=no
   to the script.
5) If you want to build Cherokee with debugging options, enable trace
   facility by passing TRACE=yes to the script.
